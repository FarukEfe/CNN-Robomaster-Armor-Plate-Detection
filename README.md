IMPORTANT !!!
=============
In order to properly run the project and test the model, you first need to follow the steps below to set up the project environment. This step includes:

- Setting up a virtual environment `.env`
- Installing the required libraries (`tensorflow`, `numpy`, etc.)
- Creating the necessary project folders.

### Set Up Virtual Environment
To set up the virtual environment, first go to the command line and navigate to the **project root directory**, which will conveniently be named as the title of this GitHub repo.

Once you're in the project rood directory, type `pip3 install virtualenv` if you do not have virtual environment tools installed in your pip version. 

After, type the following command in the command line tool: `python3 -m venv .env`. This line will create a `.env` folder that will hold all of the subsequent library installs and project settings.

However, first we need to activate the project environment, for which we'll run `.env/Scripts/activate` in the command line, from the project root directory.
